# WhoAreYouAgain? User Guide

**WhoAreYouAgain?** is a **desktop application** for managing your family contacts, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still offering the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, WhoAreYouAgain? helps you keep track of relatives and birthdays more efficiently than traditional address book apps—so you’ll never awkwardly forget a name at reunions again.

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [e/EMAIL]` can be used as `n/John Doe e/johnDoe@gmail.com` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can accept multiple values.<br>
  e.g. `delete…​` can be used as `delete 1`, `delete 1 2 4`, etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## 🔍 Searching
### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names match any of the given keywords. If no exact or partial matches are found, the app will automatically attempt a fuzzy search to suggest similar names.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* Performs an exact and partial match search first.
  If no results are found, a fuzzy search will suggest similar names instead.   
  E.g., `find Jon` can return names like `John`, `Jonathan`, or `Joni`.
* The search is case-insensitive.  
  E.g., `find hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter.  
  E.g. `find Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Prefix matching. `find Ber` will match `Bertha`, `Bernice`, `Bern` etc.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).  
  E.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

**Examples:**
* `find Jon` returns `John Doe`, `Jonathan Sim`, `Joni Tan`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`  
* `find Mich` returns `Mick`, `Mach` if there is no name 
</br>

## ⚙️ System Commands

### Undoing the last command : `undo`

Reverts the most recent supported command.

**Supported commands:** `add`, `edit`, `delete`  
Other commands like `find`, `list`, `clear`, and `help`, etc, cannot be undone.

**Format:**  `undo`

### Redoing the last undone command : `redo`

Re-applies the most recent command that was undone using `undo`.

🔄 `redo` only works if you’ve just called `undo`.  
If there's nothing to redo, the command will do nothing.

**Format:**  `redo`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

**Format:** `clear`

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a help window with guidance on using the app.

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="Ui" height="40px" width="550px"> <br>
    <br>

**Format:** `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

**Format:** `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook and command history data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`, and command history is saved as `[JAR file location]/data/commandhistory.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing these data files.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data files make their format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. This applies to both files independently - an invalid addressbook.json will cause contact data to be cleared, while an invalid commandhistory.json will cause command history to be cleared. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the files before editing them.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data files only if you are confident that you can update them correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
